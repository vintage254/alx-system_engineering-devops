What is an API
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. It defines the methods and data structures that developers can use to interact with the application or service. APIs allow different software systems to communicate with each other.

What is a REST API
A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a type of API that uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. REST APIs are designed around resources, which are identified by URLs, and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are used to perform actions on these resources. REST is stateless, meaning each request from a client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
